          <h1>Welcome to My Story</h1>
          <p>
            Hi All, Since you might already know My name is Jari Mendez, and
            welcome to my life since I started to work. I started working since
            I was 16 almost 17 years old. I was raising only by my mother, and
            nothing was provided everything was worked for. Being in High School
            I wanted freedom and money. Started working at McDonalds. That was
            my very first job. Here I learned that what is work, what is the
            other face of the world. This knowledge of work experience made me
            missed parties, classes and almost I didn't even graduate. The
            professors knew about me having a job and helped me a lot I used to
            be a 4.00-point student but, the work got into It open something
            new… something that I even knew I like. After graduating I went to
            Universidad de Puerto Rico Rencito Bayamon. I try studying for 1
            year and a half (Associate Degree in Automation, Instrumentation,
            and Control Systems Technology). Shorty, I left the university. I
            felt I wasn't learning anything at all. That associate wasn't for
            me. I thought I was smart ass I went directly to job hunting. I
            wanted to feel I was doing something productive with my time. (by
            the way I haven't quit McDonalds yet) I started working in Payless
            and Olive Garden. I was in the morning shift for McDonald's
            (6-10:30am) in payless (11am-4pm) and the night shift in Olive
            Garden (6pm - till closing). It was so dreadful (explotador) that I
            kind like that. I was young had a lot of energies and never thought
            about difficult things because one thing I always remember is my
            mother saying if I did hold a open surgery without anesthesia you
            can hold anything. I always carry that phrase everywhere I go. When
            I got promoted to Certified Trainer in Olive Garden, I quite payless
            and McDonald's stay almost full time in Olive Garden. After almost 2
            years in the company, I was never given incentives. Expensive keep
            going up but the same salary for the working class. One day a friend
            of my told me about call centers, and that was when I started in
            Conduent. I was selected and gave the 2 week notice that I might be
            moving forward. Conduent, the job was stressful but the pay at that
            time it was amazing. I called the place a debt freedom job. Not
            because the job was hard, it was the calls they were exhausting. We
            take more that 100 calls a day for The SSA and The SSI benefits.
            Imagen you only have 3 min to manage the call (ATH). Not only that,
            but you also only 30 min out of your desk. One last thing to put the
            cherry on top, for 2 week straight you had to work mandatory
            overtime for 6 days a week, only had 1 free day. After getting
            really good at the job, I was always being upgrade to floor support.
            I outstand the metric of the company and went far beyond(I never
            compete with people I compete with myself and push my self forward).
            On my free time in the company, I was learning how to be a QA for
            calls. It was interesting I found it nice. After a year and a half
            in the company I go thru serious depression, because of lack of
            money ( I was spending most of my money in dumb shit) and all of my
            bad habits. I quit Conduent looking for another job that will pay
            more that the minimum in PR. Couldn't find anything the moment I
            left so I started cleaning cars on the go. Later the month I found
            Firstbank PR, the pay rate was 10 dollars an hour. I felt that this
            was it, this is the job I was looking for. Another call center… but
            this time It was a big company, Firstbank PR. I was a regular call
            center representative, inbound and outbound call. The calls were
            better much higher time in ATH and gave monthly incentive to people
            that meet the metrics. I was aiming for being the best as always.
            After exceeding the metric in the company Covid happen. I got Covid
            in the early stages and It took 5 weeks to get a negative result.
            That put me so behind in work, I wasn't getting paid, there were no
            work from home methods. I felt like a "quedao". My debts were rising
            and rising. My pride of not being good enough in the company but
            more importantly as a person I quit before anything else happened I
            didn't want to get fired. I go to my room, and I was just playing in
            my PC 24/7 (not kidding I hided my anxiety with video games) not a
            single day pass and I was looking for a job. This is where my really
            bad habits took over my life at that point. Until one day I got a
            ultimatum from my mother and my pride again was hurt I was blind.
            Moved to Las Vegas, NV. I just wanted to make money to survive. I
            started as a bar bag. And quit the very first week. not my work
            style. Then I started in a Call center but here is where my life
            click on my brain, Knoah solution Center, Program Charter. Here I
            met a lot of humble people that humble me down again, I was living
            in a pride cloud. One day, I had no money like less that 2 dollars
            in my bank account, no one could give me a ride to the apartment I
            was staying, and I needed to go home. I was 6 miles away; my weight
            was 430 pounds. I started walking, like this is my objective I need
            to get home. My feet were burning (Las Vegas, Nevada is a desert and
            in the middle of June July not fun), water blood bubble under my
            feet. I stopped 2 times. those 2 dollars became 2 bottles of water.
            Those bottle will be my fuel to get home. After almost 3 hours
            walking, I got home crying, frustrated that I'll be left behind I
            was afraid of that. That day I promised myself this is not happening
            again. I can't let life pass around and me just enjoying shits. The
            very next day a miracle happened. I received a call from Arianis
            Rodrigues the lead of the developer PR team in Consilience
            Analytics. she goes: Hey Jari, you know about QA right?. I replied
            Yeah on calls for call centers. She instant says you will have an
            interview tomorrow with the boss. We need people and is a start up.
            I was nervous not going to lie. I thought I need this; this is my
            ticket to go back home to get back my life. Interview started and
            Andre Lefranc goes, I don't care about your work relations, I don't
            care about your study's talk to me; in that moment I felt a relief
            of any anxiety I could get from being in an interview. I started
            talking and almost 2 hours of interview pass. at the end, he goes
            you see you on Monday (it was a Friday btw) Arianis bought my return
            plane ticket to PR, an old friend give me a car that months later I
            bought. And I restarted my life again. In Consilience Analitycs is
            where I developed new habits, Jari 2.0 is here. Fun Fact I didn't
            knew NOTHING about this tech company I didn't even knew that One
            note was a thing. I have no study related; no old jobs related
            nothing. I was studying YouTube, blogs, how to etc. Until I became
            the only 3D processor in that company (in other words, the only guy
            who makes the money in the whole company). Aidas Keburys, is the
            lead of Dev team in Canada, he is the reason I enjoy UI testing new
            software. What feedbacks are the best, how to do this etc. All of
            multi tasking things that got me thinking and is so amazing not
            going to lie. Until 11/3/2022 our contract with dish they fired
            consilience from being the client. And the CEO motivates people to
            go further beyond I'll provide my 100% but my future and my debts
            needs to get paid. Therefore, I'm currently looking for a new job to
            develop and create new habits in life.
