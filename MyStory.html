          <h1>Welcome to My Story</h1>
          <pre>
                 My name is Jari Méndez, and this is the story of my proudest
            achievements. I started to work when I was 16 years old. I was
            raised solely by my mother. Nothing was provided to us so we had to
            work hard for to move forward. While in High School, all I wanted
            was to have money and freedom. Therefore, I started working at
            McDonald&#39;s. I saw, for the first time, a different side of the
            world. Since I started to work, I had to miss a lot of teenage
            experiences, missed parties, classes, and I almost didn&#39;t
            graduate. The professors knew about my situation so they helped me
            out a lot. I had a 4.0 GPA but, it became harder and harder to
            maintain it, the more I worked.
          </pre>
            <h4></h4>
          <pre>
                 After graduating from high school, I went to the University of
            Puerto Rico in Bayamón, PR. I went there for a year and a half. My
            plan was to complete an Associate Degree in Automation,
            Instrumentation, and Control Systems Technology. I felt like I
            wasn&#39;t learning anything so, I decided to leave the university.
            I believed I knew everything I needed to go hunt for a new job. I
            was certain that working would help me feel I was doing something
            productive with my time. I started working three jobs. I worked the
            morning shift at McDonald&#39;s (6AM-10:30AM), then at Payless
            (11AM-4PM) and then the night shift at Olive Garden (6PM - till
            closing). It was so exhausting, but surprisingly, I enjoyed feeling
            like that. One thing I always remember my mother saying is that if I
            was able to handle an open heart surgery without anesthesia, then I
            can handle anything. I always carry that phrase everywhere I go.
            When I got promoted, I quit my jobs at Payless and McDonald&#39;s to
            stay almost full time at Olive Garden. One day, a friend told me to
            apply to a call center, and that was when I started my new job at
            Conduent. My job there was stressful, but the pay, at that time, was
            great for me. Working there was a draining experience. At one point,
            I managed to surpass the metric of the company, which reminded me of
            how far I had gotten since I started. In my free time, I was
            learning how to be a QA (a what?) for calls. After a year and a half
            working for the call center, I went through a serious depression,
            because I would spend my money recklessly and on bad habits. I quit
            my job to look for another one that would pay more. I started
            cleaning cars. Later that month, I was offered a job at Firstbank.
            Although I was excited for this new opportunity, I wasn’t thrilled
            it was another call center. After a while, I managed to exceed the
            metric of the company, but then the COVID-19 shutdown happened. I
            was sick with the virus in the early days. It took me 5 weeks to get
            a negative result. I couldn’t work so I didn’t have any income. I
            felt like a &quot;quedao&quot; (unmotivated person) as we say in
            Puerto Rico. My debts were rising and rising. I was starting to feel
            undeserved of my job and decided to quit. I felt very anxious and
            decided to quickly look for a new job. This is where my bad habits
            took over my life. Until, one day, I got an ultimatum from my
            mother. I felt hurt and decided to move to Las Vegas, NV. I started
            as a bar bag, but only stayed one week. Then I started to work in a
            call center, Knoah Solution Center, Program Charter. One day, I had
            less than $2 in my bank account and I needed to go home, but
            couldn’t find any other way except walking. I was 6 miles away; my
            weight was 430 pounds. After almost 3 hours, I got home. That day I
            promised myself to change my life around. The very next day, I
            received a call from Arianis Rodrigues the lead of the developer PR
            team in Consilience Analytics. She sets up an interview tomorrow
            with the company’s leader. The company is a start up. At the end of
            the interview, he offers me a job and I return to Puerto Rico.
            Arianis bought me a plane ticket, and an old friend gave me a car
            that I ended up buying. In Consilience Analitycs is where I
            developed a whole set of new skills because I had no prior
            experience in this type of company. I learned through reading,
            researching and watching tutorials on the internet.

                 And one day, I managed to become the only 3D Processor there.
            Unfortunately, A very important client of us, cut out our contract.
            Therefore, I’m currently open to exploring new roles; in addition to
            develop and create new skills and experience in life.
